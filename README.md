Weather App
A simple front-end weather application that lets users search for any city and view real-time weather information using a public API.

This project is a beginner-friendly web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and display:

- Current temperature
- Weather conditions (description + icon)
- Humidity

- The ability to save favorite locations

This app demonstrates DOM manipulation, API calls using fetch(), and basic user interface layout styling.
